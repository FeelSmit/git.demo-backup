Yesterday troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks though they are here to stay 
And I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday 

Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
There is a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I don't know 
She wouldn't say

В лесу родилась ёлочка, в лесу она росла
Зимой и летом стройная, зеленая была
